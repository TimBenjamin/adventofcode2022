# Advent of Code 2022 #

These are my solutions for [AoC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2018) in Go.
(Day 1, part 1, I did in Scratch for fun... solution included in `/day_1`)

I have included my input data and the test data provided in the AoC rubric.

Run as follows:
`go run aoc.go <day> <part> path/to/input.txt`
